Description:
This program is for homeowners to look for an apartment/condo/house in NYC.
With different queries of what cities they want to be located in,
price ranges and their income, square footage of the house, and
specific bedroom and bathrooms they are looking for, Erisa's
Real Estate website will help find all. There will be charts displaying
where residencies are the most and sliders to customize NYC Housing Market.

3 Questions:
What location/city do you want to be stationed in?
What amount of bathrooms are you looking for; per locality?
What real estate group do you identify with; give a key word?

Charts: Sliders (Price), Pie Chart (Popular Locality), Bar Chart (House Type)
Click on Locality Buttons To Access Lists (Within Each)
Map: Including Every Destination
